#### API 
➜ I will be using the AIRTABLE api to get current tweets, post new tweets and delete old tweets.

#### MVP
##### Goals include:
- Functional Post button.
- Functional Delelet button.
- Create three flexpoints using CSS.
- Use React Router to view individual tweets.
- Create twitter replica with superior UI. 


#### Post-MVP
##### Nice-to-have features:
- Edit button.
- Post Pictures within tweets.
- Like Button.
- Retweet Button.

#### SWOT Analysis
 - My weakness is in mapping but I will look over my previous work to get an idea of what needs to be done. My strength is in rendering data from airtable to the DOM, so I'm sure that'll be easy.
